# Apache Celix C++ Dependency Manager

## Introduction

The C++ Dependency Manager contains a static library which can be used to manage (dynamic) services on a higher abstraction level in a declarative style. 
The Apache Celix C++ Dependency Manager is inspired by the [Apache Felix Dependency Manager](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-dependency-manager.html).

The C++ Dependency Manager uses fluent interface to make specifying DM components and service dependencies very concise and relies on features introduced in C++11.

## C++ and C Dependency Manager

The C++ Dependency Manager is build on top of the C Dependency Manager.
To get a good overview of the C++ Dependency Manager please read the [Dependency Manager documentation](../dependency_manager/README.html)

## DM Parts

The C++ Dependency Manager consist out of four main parts: `celix::dm::DmActivator`, `celix::dm::DependencyManager`, `celix::dm::Component` and `celix::dm::ServiceDependency`.

### DmActivator

The `DmActivator` class should be inherited by a bundle specific Activator. 

- The static `DmActivator::create` method needs to be implemented and should return a bundle specific subclass instance of the DmActivator.
- The `DmActivator::init` method should be overridden and can be used to specify which components to use in the bundle.
- The `DmActivator::deinit` method can be overridden if some cleanup is needed when a bundle is stopped.

### Dependency Manager

The `DependencyManager` act as an entry point to create (DM) Components.

### Component

The (DM) `Component` manages the life cycle of a component (of the template type T). For example, when all required service dependencies are available the `Component` will call the `start` specified callback function of the component.

- The `Component::setInstance` method can be used to set the component instance to used. If no instance is set the (DM) `Component` will (lazy) create a component instance using the default constructor.
- The `Component::addInterface` method can be used to specify one additional C++ service provided by the component.
- The `Component::addCInterface` method can be used to specify one additional C service provided by the component.
- The `Component::createServiceDependency` method can be used to specify one additional typed C++ service dependency.
- The `Component::createCServiceDependency` method can be used to specify one additional typed C service dependency.

### ServiceDependency and CServiceDependency

The (DM) `ServiceDependency` can be used to specify C++ service dependencies for a component and the (DM) `CServiceDependency` can be used to specify C service dependencies for a component.

When these dependencies are set to required the `Component` will ensure that components will only be started when all required dependencies are available and stop the component if any of the required dependencies are removed.
This feature should prevent a lot of boiler plating code compared to using a service tracker or services references directly. 

A service dependency update strategy can also be specified (suspend or locking. Default this strategy is set to `DependencyUpdateStrategy::suspend` this strategy will stop and start (suspend) a component when any of the specified service dependencies changes (are removed, added or modified).
When correctly used this strategy removes the need for locking services during updates/invocation. See the dependency manager_cxx example for more details.

- The `(C)ServiceDependency::setCallbacks` methods can be used to specify the function callback used when services are added, set, removed or modified. 
- The `(C)ServiceDependency::setRequired` methods can be used to specify if a service dependency is required.
- The `(C)ServiceDependency::setStrategy` methods can be used to specify the service dependency update strategy (suspend or locking).
