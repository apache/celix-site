# Experimental Rust Bundle 

This experimental bundles shows that it is possible to write a bundle in Rust, it directly uses the Apache Celix C api 
and is not intended to be used in production.

Ideally Rust support is done by adding a Rust API for Apache Celix and use that API for Rust bundles, the current
implementation only shows that is possible to write a bundle in Rust that gets called by Apache Celix framework. 

# Building

To build rust source the Corrosion cmake module is used. This module will be automatically downloaded when building 
using `FetchContent_Declare`.

To actual build the rust source files both the rust compiler and cargo are required. For ubuntu this can be installed
using apt:
```bash
sudo apt install rustc cargo
```
It is possible to define C bindings in rust manually, but this is a lot of work and error prone. Rust has a tool called
bindgen which can generate C bindings from a C header file. This is used to generate the C bindings for Apache Celix.
bindgen is used in the build.rs of the rust package `celix_bindings`.

It is also possible to run bindgen manually, for example:
```bash
cargo install bindgen # install bindgen, only needed once
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.cargo/bin # add cargo bin to path

cd misc/experimental/rust/celix_bindings
bindgen -o src/celix_bindings.rs celix_bindings.h -- -I<celix_framework_include_dir> -I<celix_utils_include_dir>
```
