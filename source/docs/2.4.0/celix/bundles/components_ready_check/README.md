# Apache Celix Component Ready

## Intro
The Apache Celix Component Ready provides an api and bundle which can be used to check if all components are ready.

## API library
The Apache Celix Component Ready Check provides a single api library `Celix::component_ready_api` which contains 
the condition id constant used to register the "components.ready" condition service.

## Bundle
The Apache Celix Component Ready Check provides the `Celix::components_ready_check` bundle which registers the
"components.ready" condition service.

The "components.ready" condition service will be registered when the "framework.ready" service is registered, 
all components have become active and the event queue is empty. 

If the "components.ready" condition service is registered and some components become inactive or the event queue is 
not empty, the "components.ready" condition is **not** removed. The "components.ready" condition is meant to indicate
that the components in the initial framework startup phase are ready.

## CMake options

- COMPONENTS_READY_CHECK=ON

## Using info

If the Apache Celix Component Ready is installed, `find_package(Celix)` will set:
- The `Celix::component_ready_api` interface (i.e. header only) library target
- The `Celix::components_ready_check` bundle target
