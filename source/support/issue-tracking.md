# Issue Tracking

Celix uses GitHub issues for bug reports, feature requests, enhancements and tasks of all kind.

Anyone with a GitHub account can use GitHub to create issues. But before doing so, please make sure that:

* the issue has not already been reported,
* the problem is actually a bug (the [mailing list](mailing-list.html) can be used for support),
* if it's a bug, you attach enough information to replicate the bug (preferably a unit test)

If you have fixed a bug or added a new feature, a [pull request](https://github.com/apache/celix/pulls) to the Celix 
repository can be created.

Celix its issues are tracked on the following pages:

- Celix main repository: https://github.com/apache/celix/issues
- Celix website repository: https://github.com/apache/celix-site/issues
