# Mailing Lists

A mailing list is an electronic discussion forum that anyone can subscribe to. When someone sends an email message 
to the mailing list, a copy of that message is broadcast to everyone who is subscribed to that mailing list. Mailing 
lists are the primary means of communication for people working on Apache projects.

**HEADS UP!**

<p class="alert alert-primary">A message sent to a public mailing list cannot be unpublished. Although we might be able to modify our own mail archives, 
the message is mirrored to a lot of other archiving systems which we do not have under control. Therefore almost 100% 
of all delete requests are denied. Please make sure you <strong>do not send any potential sensitive information to the mailing list</strong>,
including passwords, server names, ips and so on.</p>
