# Development workflow

Celix uses an adapted version of the [GitFlow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
The default branch of the Celix repositories is the `master` branch. Feature branches are created from and against the
`master` branch. Releases & hotfixes are also created from and against the `master` branch.

The following image visualizes the workflow Celix is using:
