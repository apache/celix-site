      <description>Base driver The base driver is a &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; driver that will not be loaded by the device manager. Normally the device manager will load drivers if it find device which are idle&amp;hellip; But before that can happen at least one device should exists. This is the role of a base driver and it should function like a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; OSGi bundle which registers a device service.
In this example the base driver will provide two device service with a DEVICE_CATEGORY of &amp;ldquo;char&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>High level Description: Library providing a threading pool where you can add work on the fly. The number of threads in the pool is adjustable when creating the pool. In most cases this should equal the number of threads supported by your cpu. For an example on how to use the threadpool, check the main.c file or just read the documentation found in the README.md file. In this header file a detailed overview of the functions and the threadpool&#39;s logical scheme is presented in case you wish to tweak or alter something.</description>

      <description>Why isn&amp;rsquo;t pthread_exit() used to exit a thread? thread_do used to use pthread_exit(). However that resulted in hard times of testing for memory leaks. The reason is that on pthread_exit() not all memory is freed bt pthread (probably for future threads or false belief that the application is terminating). For these reasons a simple return is used.
Interestingly using pthread_exit() results in much more memory being allocated.
Why do you use sleep() after calling thpool_destroy()?</description>

      <description>Celix Version 3 (Proposal) Intro The celix.h header contains a proposed API for Apache Celix version 3. This API is not fixed, but work in progress and should be considered a starting point for discussion.
There are a few reasons for a API change:
The current Apache Celix API is mapped from the OSGi API. The problem is that OSGi is designed for Java, a language where classes are present runtime, reflection can be used, resource are controlled through garbage collection and classes are kept available when still needed(garbage collector) even if a bundle is uninstalled.</description>

      <description>Configuration Admin  Introduction The configuration Admin service allows defining and deploying configuration data to bundles. When compared to config.properties it adds the option to update configuration data by providing a persisten storage. It also allows changing configuration data at run-time.
 Design The config_admin bundle implements the configuration_admin service, the interface to configuration objects and the interface of a managed service. At the moment, the implementation uses a config_admin_factory to generate config_admin services for each bundle that wants to use this service.</description>

      <description>Improvement Ideas Introduce dlmopen for library imports. Currently library are loaded LOCAL for bundles. This works alright, but makes it hard to add a concept of exporting and importing libraries.
The trick is that the NEEDED header in the importing libraries should match the target exported library SONAME header and no other exported libraries SONAME headers. One solution to make this work is to alter the NEEDED &amp;amp; SONAME runtime.</description>

      <description>Publisher / subscriber implementation This subdirectory contains an implementation for a publish-subscribe remote services system, that use dfi library for message serialization. For low-level communication, UDP and ZMQ is used.
Description This publisher / subscriber implementation is based on the concepts of the remote service admin (i.e. rsa / topology / discovery pattern).
Publishers are senders of data, subscribers can receive data. Publishers can publish/send data to certain channels (called &amp;lsquo;topics&amp;rsquo; further on), subscribers can subscribe to these topics.</description>

      <description>Remote Service Admin The Remote Service Admin (RSA) provides the mechanisms to import and export services when instructed to do so by the Topology Manager.
To delegate method calls to the actual service implementation, the RSA_SHM and the RSA_HTTP are using &amp;ldquo;endpoint/proxy&amp;rdquo; bundles, which has all the knowledge about the marshalling and unmarshalling of data for the service. The RSA_DFI implementation combines a foreign function interface technique together with manualy created descriptors.</description>

Apache Celix 2.0.1 Date: TBD (juli/aug 2017?)
Improve PubSub (CELIX-407)  Finalize introduction serializer services Ensure code coverage of ~ 70%  Finalize Runtime Creation (CELIX-408)  Ensure that the runtime command are used for testing some distributed test (e.g. pubsub)  Add Support for running Celix as a single executable (TODO issue) For different reasons it could be interesting to support running bundles from a single executable.</description>

      <description>Intro These examples shows howto create and interact with services by example.
In both examples there is a provider and consumer bundle. The provider bundle creates services and registers them to the Celix framework so that these services are available for use (provide). And the consumer bundle request the services from the Celix framework and uses (consumes) them.
The examples use the celix_bundleContext_registerService to provide services and uses a combination of celix_bundleContext_useService, celix_bundleContext_useServices and celix_bundleContext_trackServices to consume services.</description>

      <description>Shell The Celix Shell provides a service interface which can be used to interact with the Celix framework. Note that it does not offer a user interface. This modular approach enables having multiple frontends, e.g. textual or graphical.
While the shell can be extended with additional commands by other bundles, it already offers some built in commands:
lb list bundles install install additional bundle uninstall uninstall bundles update update bundles start start bundle stop stop bundle help displays available commands inspect inspect service and components log print log  Further information about a command can be retrieved by using help combined with the command.</description>

      <description>Topology Manager The Topology Manager decides which services should be imported and exported according to a defined policy. Currently, only one policy is implemented in Celix, the promiscuous policy, which simply imports and exports all services. Note that the Topology Manager is essential to use remote services.

      <description>Apache Celix - Using Services with C Intro This example gives an overview for providing and using services with Apache Celix with C.
Services To start of, C services in Celix are just a pointer to a memory location registered in the service registry using a name and an optional set of key/value pairs.
By convention use the following service layout:
//example.h #ifndef EXAMPLE_H_#define EXAMPLE_H_ #define EXAMPLE_NAME &amp;#34;org.example&amp;#34;#define EXAMPLE_VERSION &amp;#34;1.0.0&amp;#34;#define EXAMPLE_CONSUMER_RANGE &amp;#34;[1.</description>

      <description>Apache Celix - Using Services with C++ Intro This example gives an overview for providing and using C and C++ services with Apache Celix with C++.
Services C++ Services To start of, C++ service in Celix are just (abstract) classes.
In the following example there also a projected default constructor and destructor to ensure no instantiation / deletion of the service is possible:
#ifndef IANOTHER_EXAMPLE_H#define IANOTHER_EXAMPLE_H #define IANOTHER_EXAMPLE_VERSION &amp;#34;1.0.0&amp;#34;#define IANOTHER_EXAMPLE_CONSUMER_RANGE &amp;#34;[1.</description>

      <description>You at Apache Celix We are happy you are considering to contribute to Apache Celix and we are definitely looking forward to your work.
We all are a happy group of volunteers and much often work on Celix in our free time. We are not getting any money for our work from the Apache Software Foundation (nor does any other project receive money) and most of us are not paid by a company for working on Celix.</description>
