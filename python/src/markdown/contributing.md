# Contributing

The Celix community is open for everyone to participate in. Discussions are done over the 
[mailing lists](/support/mailinglist.html), and [issues](/support/issuetracking.html) can be created and 
seen by everyone.

If you would like to join the Celix community, a good start would be to follow the mailing list and participate in the 
discussions, use Celix and report bugs you find, possibly with patches.
