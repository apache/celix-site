# Celix Community

Celix is a community driven project, where everyone is free to download and use it. Besides using Celix we encourage 
everyone to participate in the development. This can be as simple as providing feedback and reporting bugs but could as 
well mean bug fixes and code contributions.

While Celix was in incubation at the Apache Incubator, the status had to be reported to the Incubator PMC. These
reports are also available on this site.
