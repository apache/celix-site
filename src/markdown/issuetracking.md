# Issue Tracking

Celix uses Jira for bug reports, feature requests, enhancements and tasks of all kind.

Anyone can use Jira to report bugs. But before doing so, please make sure that:

- the bug isn't already reported,
- the problem is actually a bug (the [mailing list](/support/mailinglist.html) can be used for support),
- you attach enough information to replicate the bug (preferably a unit test)

If you have fixed a bug, the patch can be attached to a bug report.

The Celix Jira Issue Tracker can be found at:

 - <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/celix>
